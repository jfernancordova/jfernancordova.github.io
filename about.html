                    Hi, I'm José Fernando, a Backend Developer and Information Technology Student. I'm currently
                    working on RESTful APIs and Dockerized development environments.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I'm passionate about PHP, Golang, Docker, and Linux. I started to love programming, software
                    stuff, and technologies thanks to my teachers and friends ever since I finished high school. I
                    fought against myself because I did not understand how to think like a developer, so I decided
                    to find a mentor, read a lot, and practice a lot. <strong> I never stop
                    learning! </strong>
                    <br/><br/>
                    I'm proficient in working across all the stages of <strong>Software Development Life
                    Cycle</strong> that includes planning, coding and deployments via multiple application servers
                    and thought automation.

                <hr/>
                <p>While I was working and googling, the google search showed me something particular: <strong>You’re
                    speaking our language. Up for a challenge?</strong>. Thanks to this <a
                        href="https://medium.com/plutonic-services/ things-you-should-know-about-google-foobar-invitation-703a535bf30f">article</a>
                    I realized that it was a real and extraordinary invitation!</p>
                <p>This opportunity makes me think that all my learning is valuable. Unfortunately, I could not
                    complete it because of work, assignments from college, and other responsibilities. I hope
                    someday to try it. I’m on the right way!</p>
