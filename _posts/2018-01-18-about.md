# Introducing myself
---

<div style="text-align: justify">
Hi! I'm José Fernando, a Backend Developer and an IT student originally from Venezuela and currently living in Argentina.
<br>
I'm passionate about PHP, Golang, Docker, and Linux. I would like to say that I was a geek all my life, but I wasn't.
<br>
I started to love programming, software stuff, and technologies thanks to my friends and teachers ever since I finished high school. I fought against myself because I did not understand how to think like a developer, but with practice, reading a lot, and listen to masters or craftsmanships around the world, I can finally say that it's possible.
<br>
This is why I always say to my friends, mates, or any person who wants to learn to program, it's possible.
</div>

## I have a few hobbies
---
- I like to play Tables Tennis, watch documentaries, series or movies and sometimes go out with my friends.

- I like to study, research, and read about software development all the time.

- I like reading about life, good habits, and meditation.

## I got a Google Foobar Invitation
---

While I was working and googling, the google search showed me something particular: **You're speaking our language. Up for a challenge?**. Thanks to this [article](https://medium.com/plutonic-services/ things-you-should-know-about-google-foobar-invitation-703a535bf30f) I realized that it was a real and extraordinary invitation!

This opportunity makes me think that all my learning is valuable. Unfortunately, I could not complete it because of work, assignments from college, and other responsibilities. I hope someday to try it. I'm on the right way!
