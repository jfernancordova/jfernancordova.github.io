# Who I Am
---

<div style="text-align: justify">
Hi!, I'm Jos√© Fernando, a Web Developer focused on Backend Development and an IT student originally from Venezuela and currently living in Argentina.
<br>
I'm passionate about PHP, Golang, Docker, and Linux. I would like to say that I was a geek all my life, but I wasn't.
<br>
I started to love programming, software stuff, and technologies thanks to my friends and teachers ever since I finished high school. I fought against myself because I did not understand how to think like a developer, but with practice, reading a lot, and listen to masters or craftsmanships around the world, I can finally say that it's possible.
<br>
This is why I always say to my friends, mates, or any person who wants to learn to program, it's possible.

## I have a few hobbies
---
- I like to play Tables Tennis, watch documentaries, series or movies with my girlfriend and sometimes go out with my friends.

- I like to study, research, read about software development all the time, also I like reading about life, good habits, and meditation.
