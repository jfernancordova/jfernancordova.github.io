## Productivity

- I use [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) to track my personal-work goals and habits.
- I write my thoughts and ideas using [The 1% Diary](https://thediary.com/products/one-percent-diary).
- Sometimes I use [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) to memorize and understand complex concepts.
