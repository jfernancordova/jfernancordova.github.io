## Introduction

As a software engineer, I used to juggle many tasks at the same time, believing that doing so would allow me to achieve my goals faster. This multitasking became a habit, but it turned out to be my biggest mistake.

I often tackled minor tasks during meetings or while watching tutorials. This made me feel productive and motivated, so I decided to take on more significant tasks simultaneously, thinking it would make me even more efficient and satisfied. 

The outcome of this experience was:

- **Anger without reason**: This affected my relationships with family, coworkers, and close friends.
- **Lack of communication**: I struggled to express myself clearly, which impacted my ability to make decisions and perform my job effectively.
- **Loss of confidence**: I became unwilling to take risks or make work-related decisions.
- **90% sad & 10% happy**: Regardless of holidays or time off work, it was difficult to feel happy or optimistic. Sadness and frustration were constant companions.

After maintaining this approach for so long, I realized I was easily frustrated, anxious, and stuck in my comfort zone. This had consequences in both my personal and professional life. I knew I needed a solution, so I began investigating the causes of my burnout and simple strategies to avoid it.

## Exercise

Engaging in home exercises or any sport during the week is important for relaxing the mind and improving overall well-being.

- Exercising for just 15 minutes in the morning sets a positive tone for the day. It helps me process information better and prevents fatigue after meals. When working from home, I use the treadmill or indoor bike; otherwise, I ride a public bike.
- I enjoy playing table tennis, which I had stopped during my burnout. I've now returned to it, playing at least once a week.
- I also started boxing, thanks to a teammate. It's a new experience for me, and while I'm still a beginner, I've come to love it.

## Vitamins and Minerals

- **Magnesium**: Helps me sleep 8–9 hours per night.
- **Omega-3**: Supports mental health, benefiting both depression and anxiety.
- **[AG1](https://drinkag1.com/)**: A comprehensive supplement with 75 vitamins, minerals, and nutrients per serving.

## Meditation

I was initially skeptical of meditation, often dismissing it as ineffective. However, I decided to try it daily.

At first, it was challenging to relax and stay calm without doing anything. With practice, I learned that meditation helps keep you in the present, freeing you from dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. Living in the present allows you to appreciate life, which fosters optimism and happiness.

I use [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) every morning before starting work. While I still get distracted, I ultimately feel at peace and enthusiastic about my day.

## Mindset

A clear mind has helped me to understand, listen, think, and respond to various situations.

This is a personal manifesto that I strive to follow:

- I must remain optimistic, as negativity rarely leads to good results.
- I must not dwell on past thoughts and instead focus on living in the present.
- I must question my future thoughts, asking "why" or "how" to better understand them.
- I must listen and pay attention carefully before speaking.
- I must be friendly and appreciative of the people around me.

## Career Growth

Exercise, meditation, healthy eating, and maintaining a positive mindset are, in my experience, the key components of a good life. It's okay to encounter unexpected situations that trigger old habits or negative thoughts—the important thing is to take action, reflect, learn, and apply new strategies.

To reignite my passion for work, I developed a career growth plan that has helped me improve in various aspects:

- I wrote down my challenges, such as distractions during meetings, lack of participation, and lack of interest.
- I took steps to change my behavior: taking notes during meetings, asking questions, offering help, and becoming more involved.
- I started writing and drawing to better understand the information I received. If I couldn't grasp the big picture, procrastination, fear, and anxiety would take over, hindering my productivity.

## Conclusion

Burnout is real and profoundly impacted my life. However, this experience allowed me to grow, as it highlighted the importance of being mindful in life and changing my habits to be happy, honest, and appreciative of each moment.
