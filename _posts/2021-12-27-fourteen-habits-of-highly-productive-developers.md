## Introduction
---

I read this book because good habits help us become more productive, happy, passionate, and motivated. It is perfectly normal to feel unproductive for whatever cause, which is why we must fight ourselves over and over to reach our objectives.

As Software Engineers, it's always interesting to hear the perspectives of other developers who have developed good habits in many areas, that's why I'll quote the most fascinating topics from this book.

## Habit 1: Look For The Signal
---

- Avoid FOMO (the fear of missing out), adapt JOMO (the joy of missing out) instead, for any tool, programming language or frameworks.
- Desires are endless; needs are limited.
- Questions & Answers:
  - Focus on a few key things that drive our evaluations.
  - Accept that you cannot learn everything, you can learn enough to be effective though.

##  Habit 2: Focus On The Fundamentals
---

- It is important to understand core concepts such as algorithms, logic, network, accessibility, security and user experience.
