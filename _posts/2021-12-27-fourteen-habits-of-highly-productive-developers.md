## Introduction
---

I read this book because good habits help us become more productive, happy, passionate, and motivated. It is perfectly normal to feel unproductive for whatever cause, which is why we must fight ourselves over and over to reach our objectives.

As Software Engineers, it's always interesting to hear the perspectives of other developers who have developed good habits in many areas, that's why I'll quote the most fascinating topics from this book.

<br>

## Habit 1: Look For The Signal
---

- Avoid FOMO (the fear of missing out), adapt JOMO (the joy of missing out) instead, for any tool, programming language or frameworks.
- Desires are endless; needs are limited.
- Questions & Answers:
  - Focus on a few key things that drive our evaluations.
  - Accept that you cannot learn everything, you can learn enough to be effective though.
  
<br>

##  Habit 2: Focus On The Fundamentals
---

- It is important to understand core concepts such as algorithms, logic, network, accessibility, security and user experience.
- Try to get a basic understanding of the key concepts and search for examples of how others solve similar problems with it.
  
<br>

##  Habit 3: Teaching Equals Learning
---

- Find an event online and submit a presentation.
- Create an blog and share articles.
- One way of truly knowing a concept or techonology is trying to create a practical project.

<br>

##  Habit 4: Be Boring
---

- Infinitive Game vs Finite Game 
  - A finite game:
      - Programemers are focused on their bonus at the end of the year or waiting for that freelance project to end. 
  - A infinite game:
    - The rules are changeable.
    - New paradigm emerge.
    - New patterns emerge.
    - You cannot win in programming, you can only keep envolving the software to be better, more scalable, and more useful every day.
- Best programmers are reliable. You cannot have consistency without reliability.
- Best programmers don't give estimations based on perfect conditions.

<br>

##  Habit 5: Do It For Your Future Self
---

- Don't try to be clever, don't try to code something to make you feel smarter.
- You don't need to show off all the new tricks you just learned. Just write readable code.
- Thing about maintainability, meaningful names for every class, variable and methods.
- Have a good automated testing and use the version control as documentation.
- Early optimization is the root of all evil.
- No code should be added without unit tests, no bug fixed without a regression test. 

<br>

##  Habit 6: Your 9-to-5 Is Not Enough
---

- You can watch Netflix and still be productive.
- You can play any sport and still work on an open source project.
- You can enjoy quality time with your family and still read a book.

<br>

##  Habit 7: Master The Dark Side
---

> A person who knows how to code is powerful, a person who knows how to code and knows how business works is unstoppable.

- <strong>Save time:</strong> The better you understand the business, the more capable you will be to solve those problems yourself.
- <strong>Prevent complex code:</strong> when you have domain expertise, you are in a much better position to determine what part of the codebase needs more attention than others.
- <strong>Better prioritize: </strong> With better business knowledge it is easier to prioritize the micro-decisions you need to make when coding.
- Developers are essentially translators, our job is to translate user requirements into functionalities.
- Getting information from a key stakeholder can be very tricky since we all have a different understanding of the system.
- Light Side can be considered as programming, whereas Dark Side would be the business. The more we know about the business, the more valuable we are to the team.
- Start with the vocabulary, pay attention to the specific words and terms used by the business folks. You need to emulate the same terminology, because the communication will be much more effective.
- The best way to make sure I'm delivering something useful to the client is try to understand the business side.
