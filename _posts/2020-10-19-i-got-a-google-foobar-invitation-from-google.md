## The Google Foobar Invitation
---

While I was working and googling, google search showed me something particular: **You're speaking our language. Up for a challenge?**. Thanks to this [article](https://medium.com/plutonic-services/ things-you-should-know-about-google-foobar-invitation-703a535bf30f) I realized that it was a real invitation!

This opportunity makes me think that all my learning is valuable. Unfortunately, I could not complete it because of work, assignments from college, and responsibilities with my girlfriend. I hope someday to try. I'm on the right way!
