## Editor

I use PHPStorm as my primary editor and Visual Studio Code as my second one. My default theme is [GitHub Theme](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15418-github-theme) and [Monalisa](https://www.monolisa.dev/) as global font. Thanks to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDMI1dpNfdw&feature=youtu.be&t=353), I love using light mode for almost everything!

## Terminal

I use [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) with [Oh My Tmux! Pretty & versatile tmux configuration](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux).

Sometimes when I need to modify specific files, VIM with [The Ultima vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc) is my best choice.
I don't have many aliases, so I use [Github Gists](https://gist.github.com/jfernancordova/b98bb2259a02755bf26cd17a6a1c386b) to remember some shortcuts or commands.

## Productivity
---
* [GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/) is a great solution for me.
* I use [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) for my personal, work, and university activities.
* I use [Planner](https://github.com/alainm23/planner) as To Do List.
* I mix Notion with GTD thanks to this [article](https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/how-to-set-up-gtd-in-notion/).
* Sometimes I use [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) to study an exam or understand complex concepts.

<br>

## Environment
---
* I use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for testing, coding, and deployments APIs or Apps.
* I use [Play With Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/) with [Travis](https://travis-ci.com/) and [Continous Integration](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/guides/about-continuous-integration).
